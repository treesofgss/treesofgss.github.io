#Aim and Objectives

**Aim**  

To design and implement a user friendly Tree identification online repository for GSS College campus using Free and Open Source technology.  

**Objectives**  

Scientific Assessment of tree diversity in the GSS college campus using standard procedure. 
Creating an open source web portal using smart techniques for mass awareness and outreach.
Strategize for concept popularization and dissemination.

#Methodology

A detailed assessment of all tree species in the GSS College campus was undertaken in the beginning of the project by surveying the campus. The trees are distributed across 34 acre area. 
Campus was divided into small regions for efficient documentation process. 

A standard procedure was followed to document important morphological features of all the tree species present in the campus.   
Tree species were classified scientifically using the G.Bentham and J.D.Hooker system of classification.
Species identification was confirmed by referring available regional field guides like  … ” TREES OF PUNE” and “AVENUE TREES”,” FLOWERS OF SAHYADRI”.
Discrepancies in the identification of trees was resolved, by following systemic classification process based on the morphological characteristics.
